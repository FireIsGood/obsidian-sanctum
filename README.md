# obsidian-sanctum
Sanctum’s a minimalist theme with the aim of creating a serene space of retreat, for thought and uninterrupted work.

## Installation
You can manually install the following theme by:
1. downloading the CSS file and moving it into the folder `.obsidian/themes/` located in your vault folder
2. rename the css file to `Sanctum.css`
3. in Obsidian, go to `Settings ➞ Appearance ➞ Themes ➞ Reload themes`, and select `Sanctum`.

## Disclaimer
The following theme significantly alters Obsidian's original css, and so is prone to breaking upon new Obsidian updates, as well as being incompatible with custom css snippets. It is also in a very early stage of development, and so quick and sometimes drastic changes may be expected in the near future. Any and every piece of feedback is appreciated. Do keep in mind that, ultimately, the author's vision for this theme takes precedence. More intuitive customization options will be available in the future.
