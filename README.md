Sanctum’s a minimalist theme for creating a serene space of retreat, for thought and uninterrupted work.

## Sanctum 1.0 for Obsidian 0.16

Sanctum is being completely rewritten from scratch for the release of Obsidian 0.16. This means that while some features are already included, others may be completely deprecated, and new ones developed in its place. You can expect regular changes in the foreseeable future. Many of the core features have already been added and expanded upon (e.g. custom checkboxes, image position and sizing, sidenotes, etc), but there's still a lot to do in regards to UI and icon replacement (even though that UI Components have already been completely revamped).


## Installation
Inside obsidian, go to `Settings ➞ Appearance ➞ Manage`, and look for `Sanctum`.

You can also manually install Sanctum by:
1. Downloading the CSS file and moving it into the folder `.obsidian/themes/` located in your vault folder;
2. Rename the css file to `Sanctum.css`;
3. In Obsidian, go to `Settings ➞ Appearance ➞ Themes ➞ Reload themes`, and select `Sanctum`.

## Disclaimer
The following theme significantly alters Obsidian's original css, and so is prone to breaking upon new Obsidian updates, as well as being incompatible with custom css snippets, which might require specific adjustments.

## Design Principles

**Intentional**
  - This theme was made with the intent of clarifying Obsidian's UI, reducing the unnecessary clutter and keeping what's essential for an enjoyable and intuitive experience;
  - Greyscale palette is the same both for light as well as dark theme;
  - Colour is also used for contrast when hovering and activating elements.

**Consistent**
  - Every element is styled according to a predetermined grid, scale, animations (based on IBM's Carbon Design System) and colours - this conveys consistency throughout the theme;
  - The theme was created with the intention of using only one workhorse font family, used everywhere, but styled differently. Thus the theme comes with only 1 font family - IBM Plex
  - Offer a similar enjoyable experience, independently of screen size or device.

**Clean**
  - Use of calming colours, only used either to convey importance, or in the note file itself;
  - The background colour is the same in every element, to reduce visual noise and give a more calming atmosphere;
  - Elements are related to each other using the rules of visual *gestalt*. This means that they're grouped by proximity, in a common region or as a focal point.
